Learn GNU make
===============
This is work in progress; bear with me.
The goal is to share my knowledge about GNU make and in the process help others who are trying to learn it.
My hope is that by the end of the tutorials you will have sufficient knowledge of make and makefile to be able to use it to build your own applications.

1. [Introduction to GNU make](./introduction.md).
    * GNU make concepts.
2. Build an executable.
    * Build enviroments.
3. Building an executable with sources structured in sub-directories.
4. Building shared libraries.
5. Putting it all together.
6. Building rpm files.
